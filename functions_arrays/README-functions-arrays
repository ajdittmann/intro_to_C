functions-arrays*.c are codes written in C that show simple 
	1- and 2D arrays, and how to operate on them using functions

Associated files:

Compile with:
    gcc functions-arrays.c -o functions -lm

Run with:
    ./functions

Exercises A - See how ./functions behaves when you:
	1. Change Nx or Ny
	2. Try to print out the values after malloc but before initializing the 1D array
    3. change the math operations in set_values
    4. In python, you can get the last index of an array by indexing with [-1]. What happens hear if you index a 1D array with [-1]? How does it compare with the value at [Nx-1]?
