basic_types.c is a code written in C that shows properties of the different basic
	variable types in C (mainly char, int, float, double). The code takes no
	inputs and prints to the screen several pre-defined tables indicating the
	maximum and minimum values which can be stored in each variable type as well
	as the precision of the different floating point values. The
	basic_types__uncommented.c file is provided if the user desires a reference
	less cluttered by comments, but operates identically.
