Associated files:
* loops.c
* loops_uncommented.c
* README-loops

Compile with:
```
gcc loops.c -o loops -lm
```

Run with:
```
./loops
```

Exercises A - See how ./loops behaves when you:
1. change the value of N
2. rewrite the 'for' loop as a 'while' loop
3. change how M is modified in each logical statement
