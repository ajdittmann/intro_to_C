functions-loops*.c are codes written in C that show simple 
	examples of functions which can compute mathematical 
	operations and interact with global variables, using 
	different kinds of loops

Compile with:
    gcc functions-loops.c -o functions -lm

Run with:
    ./functions

Exercises A - See how ./functions behaves when you:
	1. the value in #define N
	2. add a line changing the value of N in main()
    3. rewrite the 'for' loop as a 'while' loop
	4. change how M is modified in each logical statement
