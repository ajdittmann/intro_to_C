functions-basic*.c are codes written in C that show simple 
	examples of functions which can compute mathematical 
	operations and interact with global variables,
	printing the results.

Compile with:
    gcc functions-basic.c -o functions -lm

Run with:
    ./functions

Exercises A - See how ./functions behaves when you:
    1. change the values of x and y
    2. try changing the value of the argument to 'changeM'
    3. see what happens when you give 'changeM' a non-integer argument
	4. try changing the 'magnitude' function to something else
    5. (challenge) see what happens when you give 'changeM' a non-numerical argument
